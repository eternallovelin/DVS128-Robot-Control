DVS128-Robot-Control
====================

This is the code for my masters project at Edinburgh University: it involves controlling a BioLoid Premium vehicle robot using the DVS128 asynchronous sensor. Camera details: siliconretina.ini.uzh.ch/

The software requires the jAER framework, which can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/jaer/wiki. 

The program is used to navigate a BioLoid vehicle using the DVS128 sensor through a corridor setting, based on observations by Srinivasan on honeybee flight behavior.
